# ADC_PROJECT
# Real-Time ADC Signal Visualization Using Python

This project demonstrates a real-time ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) signal visualization system using Python. The system consists of two components: a **server** that reads ADC data from a text file and sends it over a socket connection, and a **client** that receives this data and plots it live using Matplotlib and Tkinter.

## Features
- Real-time data transmission over TCP/IP sockets
- Client-side dynamic plotting of ADC signal values
- Easy integration with different ADC data files
- Modular Python code for both server and client

## Motivation
During my internship at GS Co., Ltd., South Korea, I worked on signal processing techniques including FIR and FFT algorithms for noise reduction in load cell sensors. This project simulates ADC data streaming and visualization as part of the internship's practical applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Socket programming
- Matplotlib for plotting
- Tkinter for GUI
- Virtual environments for dependency management
